Crude oil prices wield immense influence over global economies and geopolitical affairs. In this paper, we focus on forecasting the prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, a vital benchmark in the United States, spanning from 1990 to 2023 at weekly intervals.

Energy markets, particularly oil, are highly sensitive to geopolitical events and economic shocks, making forecasting a formidable challenge. We aim to explore the multifaceted factors that influence crude oil prices and their significance across industries.

By understanding price trends, businesses can make informed decisions, manage risks, and identify opportunities. However, accurately forecasting crude oil prices requires navigating the complexities of supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical influences, and macroeconomic trends.
